# frc-rpi-vision
Raspberry Pi Vision Experiments for FRC

# Steps to get started

Based on https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/vision/l/687863-off-board-vision-processing-in-java

These steps assume development is not performed on the Raspberry Pi itself,
though it is possible to set up a dev folder on the board and work there.

1. Set up a new folder for development. In that folder, clone this project:

```
git clone https://github.com/jgkatz/frc-rpi-vision.git
```

I originally set up this project by pulling in the vision sample code from FRC
